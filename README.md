# Speech Emotion Recognition 🎙️😃😢😡

This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes audio files and classifies emotions such as calm, happy, fearful, and disgust.

## 📂 Project Files
- **`speech_emo.py`** → Python script for feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Features
- Uses `librosa` for audio processing.
- Extracts MFCC, chroma, and mel-spectrogram features.
- Trains an MLPClassifier to classify emotions.
- Achieves high accuracy on test data.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy librosa scikit-learn soundfile
2. Run the script:
    ```sh
   python speech_emo.py

## Dataset Used
This project uses the RAVDESS dataset for emotion recognition.

## 📢 Future Improvements  
🔹 Try **Deep Learning models** like **CNN** or **LSTMs** for improved accuracy.  
🔹 Experiment with **more features** like pitch and energy levels.  
🔹 Create a **real-time emotion detection app** using Flask or Streamlit.
